# Method 1

## Prerequisites

1. **WhatsApp Business Account**: You need a WhatsApp Business API account. Sign up on the [WhatsApp Business API page](https://www.whatsapp.com/business/api) or through a WhatsApp Business Solution Provider like Twilio, MessageBird, or others.
   
2. **Business Verification**: Ensure your business is verified by Facebook to use the WhatsApp Business API.

3. **Developer Skills**: Basic understanding of programming (JavaScript, Python, or any other language) and familiarity with APIs.

4. **Hosting Service**: A server to host your chatbot application (e.g., AWS, Heroku, or any other hosting provider).

## Steps to Create a WhatsApp Chatbot

1. **Sign Up for WhatsApp Business API**
   - Register and get your WhatsApp Business API setup through a solution provider like Twilio, MessageBird, or others.

   - Follow the provider’s instructions to configure your WhatsApp Business API.

2. **Choose a Platform/Framework**
   - Use platforms like **Twilio**, **Dialogflow**, **Botpress**, or **ManyChat** which provide integrations for WhatsApp chatbots.

   - For this guide, we'll use Twilio and a simple Node.js setup as an example.

3. **Set Up Your Development Environment**
   - Install Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) on your system.

   - Create a new directory for your project and initialize it with `npm init`.

   - Install necessary packages:

    
```bash
npm install express twilio body-parser
```
    

4. **Write the Chatbot Logic**
   - Create a simple Express server and integrate Twilio’s WhatsApp API:

     Certainly! Here is the provided JavaScript code for setting up a simple Express server and integrating Twilio’s WhatsApp API:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const twilio = require('twilio');

const app = express();
app.use(bodyParser.urlencoded({ extended: false }));

const accountSid = 'your_twilio_account_sid';
const authToken = 'your_twilio_auth_token';
const client = new twilio(accountSid, authToken);

app.post('/whatsapp', (req, res) => {
    const messageBody = req.body.Body;
    const fromNumber = req.body.From;

    let responseMessage = 'Welcome to HR Bot. How can I assist you today?';

    if (messageBody.toLowerCase().includes('job')) {
        responseMessage = 'Please send your resume to hr@company.com';
    }

    client.messages
        .create({
            body: responseMessage,
            from: 'whatsapp:+14155238886', // Twilio Sandbox number
            to: fromNumber
        })
        .then((message) => console.log(message.sid));

    res.send('<Response></Response>');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server is running on port 3000');
});
```

   - Replace `'your_twilio_account_sid'` and `'your_twilio_auth_token'` with your actual Twilio credentials.

   - This example responds with a message based on the user’s input.

5. **Configure Webhook in Twilio**
   - Go to your Twilio console and configure the webhook URL to point to your server (e.g., `http://yourserver.com/whatsapp`).

6. **Test Your Chatbot**
   - Use Twilio’s sandbox environment to test your chatbot.

   - Send messages to your WhatsApp bot and check if it responds appropriately.

## Additional Features
- **Resume Parsing**: Integrate a resume parser to extract details from submitted resumes.

- **Database Integration**: Store user data and interactions in a database like MongoDB or Firebase.

- **Natural Language Processing**: Use Dialogflow or similar NLP services to handle complex queries and responses.

- **Interactive Menus**: Create menus for users to navigate through different options.

## Deployment
- Deploy your application on a hosting service (e.g., Heroku, AWS).

- Ensure your server is secure and can handle incoming requests efficiently.
